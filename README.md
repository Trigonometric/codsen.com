# Codsen.com

This is the source of [codsen.com](https://codsen.com)

It was coded on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) as a templating language. Custom design and custom, hand-written CSS, like in the olden days.

Our CI of choice is [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com/), it's faster than GitHub Actions.

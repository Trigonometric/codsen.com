This website was designed in Photoshop, except _SVG's_ which were done in Illustrator and _drawings_ were done in Adobe Fresco app on iPad. We have Sketch licence, but UI is too advanced for it (take fading [green marker macro shot](https://codsen.com/images/green_marker.png), for example).

It was coded on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) as a templating language.

GitLab CI automatically deploys _master_ branch to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

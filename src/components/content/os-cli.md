All the following libraries are command-line applications. You install them using `-g` flag via npm, for example, `npm i -g json-sort-cli`. Often a package/library/program would have its CLI counterpart: you can use a package programmatically, inside your programs, or you can use its CLI in the terminal, as a standalone program.

For example, `csv-sort` package is string-in, string-out function. It's meant to be used by websites, CLI's and Node programs. `csv-sort-cli` taps it and adds file I/O layer and lets you read/write/sort files directly, via a command line.
